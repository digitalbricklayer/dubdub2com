My names is Jack Hughes and I am relatively new to wargaming. My journey started in September 2016 with a game of Memoir '44. Just one game was enough to wet my appetite.

We are very lucky living in West Yorkshire to have three wargaming conventions close by. After my one game of Memoir '44, I headed to my local show which happily was happening soon after. I attended [FIASCO](https://leedswargamesclub.com/sig-int/f/fiasco-22) at the [Royal Armouries](https://royalarmouries.org/) in Leeds and discovered the world of participation tabletop wargames.

## A Sampling of Flames of War

Whilst at FIASCO for the first time I encountered the Night Owls wargaming club. Happily the club meet every Sunday morning within 30 minutes drive of my home. I eventually ventured forth one Sunday and attended the club. I was given a warm welcome and was introduced to the joys of tabletop wargaming. My first game proper was Flames of War v3.
