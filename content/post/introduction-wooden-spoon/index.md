I am relatively new to wargaming. My journey started in September 2016 with a game of Memoir '44. Just the one game was enough was sufficient to wet my appetite.

Living in West Yorkshire we are very lucky to have a couple of wargaming conventions. This is where I headed next. I attended FIASCO at the [Royal Armouries](https://royalarmouries.org/) in Leeds and discovered the world of participation games.
