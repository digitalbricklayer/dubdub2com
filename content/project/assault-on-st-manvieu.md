## Models Required

This project doesn't require a huge amount of painting as I already have most of the models. Just need to fill in a few gaps.

As you can see this will be a very short project. The longest part of it will be waiting for the parts to arrive from [Baccus 6mm]({{< ref "/supplier/baccus-6mm" >}}).

The German sniper is going to be a slight problem. I haven't been able to find a sniper model from either Baccus 6mm or 2D6 so I'm going to need to use a non sniper model. I'll see if I can find a rifleman and his buddy and use that instead. Two models on a base instead of the usual four.
