Paint the extra models necessary to play the Assault on St. Manvieu scenario from the ['O' Group Normandy scenario book](https://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/en-gb/products/1944-normandy-for-o-group).

## Models Required

This project doesn't require a huge amount of painting as I already have most of the models. Just need to fill in a few gaps.

### British

- 1 British PIAT anti-tank units
- 2 Churchill MkIV 6pdr
- 1 Churchill Crocodile

### German

- 1 German sniper unit
- 1 Panzer IVJ 75mm L48

As you can see above this will be a very short project. The longest part of it will be waiting for the parts to arrive from Baccus 6mm.
